# Motivation

Existing state libs require developers to update state behind a **facade of user-defined abstractions**.
For example, behind a user-defined function (like with Redux or Zustand), or a user-defined atom hook (like Recoil or React Query).

These user-defined abstractions introduce a set of ambiguities, namely:
* **What** state is available?
* **Which** state is being updated?
* **How** is state being updated?

Olik's goal is to shift the job of defining state update abstractions from the developer to the library.
Olik's goal is to make managing 'managed' state as easy and transparent as updating 'local' state.
* A **fluent api** means that state can be ***discovered*** from within components.
* **Standard** update primitives **eliminate ambiguity** by clearly deliniating replace / insert / merge / etc operations.
* State updates are **described for you with perfect accuracy** from within the devtools.
* The need to test state update logic is eliminated because that logic is encapsulated within the library.
* While the library weighs in at 5kb, the application-bundle size should be even smaller because the developer is not required to define any state-update abstractions.

Furthermore, Olik supports component stores which will automatically nest inside a global store (if it exists).
The goal is to shift local component state into your store(s) by making it as easy (if not easier) to work with.



Existing state managers require developers to update state indirectly, behind a facade of abstractions.

Olik is designed to lower the barrier to entry so that more state can be managed globally
